## Download and Installation

1. Download the appropriate `sonar-build-breaker-plugin-${version}.jar` file from the [releases page](https://github.com/SonarQubeCommunity/sonar-build-breaker/releases), based on the compatibility chart
2. Copy the plugin into `/path/to/sonarqube/extensions/plugins/`
3. Remove older versions of the plugin from `/path/to/sonarqube/extensions/plugins/`, if present
4. Restart SonarQube

## Description

This plugin will mark the build failed if the project fails its quality gate or uses a forbidden configuration.  These
checks happen after analysis has been submitted to the server, so it does not prevent a new analysis from showing up in
SonarQube.

Upon uploading the analysis information, the plugin follows the below workflow to check the quality gate:

1. Search `${sonar.working.directory}/report-task.txt` for `ceTaskId`, the server-side Compute Engine (CE) task associated with the current analysis
2. Call the `${sonar.host.url}/api/ce/task?id=${ceTaskId}` web service to retrieve `analysisId`
  1. If the CE Task Status is `PENDING` or `IN_PROGRESS`, wait `sonar.buildbreaker.queryInterval` and repeat step 2
  2. If the CE Task Status is `SUCCESS`, save the `analysisId` and proceed to step 3
  3. If the CE Task Status is `FAILED` or none of the above, break the build
  4. If step 2 has been attempted `sonar.buildbreaker.queryMaxAttempts` times, break the build
3. Call the `${sonar.host.url}/api/qualitygates/project_status?analysisId=${analysisId}` web service to check the status of the quality gate
  1. If the quality gate status is `OK`, allow the build to pass
  2. If the quality gate status is `WARN`, allow the build to pass and log the current warnings
  3. If the quality gate status is `ERROR`, break the build and log the current warnings and errors

The build "break" is accomplished by throwing an exception, making the analysis return with a non-zero status code.
This allows you to benefit from the notifications built into CI engines or use your own custom notifications that check the
exit status.

## Usage

### Quality Gate Build Breaker

This build breaker is only available in publish mode (`sonar.analysis.mode=publish`, the default).
SonarQube calculates the quality gate status server-side, and only publish mode sends analysis results
to the server.

1. Associate a quality gate to your project
2. Optional: Tune `sonar.buildbreaker.queryMaxAttempts` and/or `sonar.buildbreaker.queryInterval`
  1. Check the duration of previous CE (background) tasks for your project, from submission until completion
  2. Ensure `sonar.buildbreaker.queryMaxAttempts * sonar.buildbreaker.queryInterval` is longer than the above duration (with default values, total wait time is ~5 minutes)
  3. For small projects, a faster interval may be desired so your build times are not longer than necessary
  4. For very large projects or servers with a busy CE queue, more attempts or a longer interval may be necessary
3. Run an analysis on your project
4. If analysis fails while waiting for CE to complete, increase either `sonar.buildbreaker.queryMaxAttempts`, `sonar.buildbreaker.queryInterval`, or both

### Forbidden Configuration Build Breaker

Define the property `sonar.buildbreaker.forbiddenConf` with comma-separated `key=value` configurations that will break
the build.

For example, if you set the property to `sonar.gallio.mode=skip`, each analysis on .NET projects executed with
Gallio skipped will be marked "broken".

### Issues Severity Build Breaker

This build breaker is only available in preview modes (`sonar.analysis.mode=preview` or
`sonar.analysis.mode=issues`).  In publish mode, issue severity data is not available to post-job
checkers.

1. Define the property `sonar.buildbreaker.preview.issuesSeverity`
2. Define `sonar.analysis.mode=preview`
3. Ensure `sonar.preview.excludePlugins` does not have `buildbreaker` in the list (prior to SonarQube 6.2, it is in the list by default)

### Configuration Parameters

| Property | Description | Default value | Example |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------- |
| `sonar.buildbreaker.skip` | If set to true, the quality gate is not checked.  By default the build will break if the project does not pass the quality gate. | `false` | |
| `sonar.buildbreaker.queryMaxAttempts` | The maximum number of queries to the API when waiting for report processing.  The build will break if this is reached.  Total wait time is `sonar.buildbreaker.queryMaxAttempts * sonar.buildbreaker.queryInterval`. | `30` | |
| `sonar.buildbreaker.queryInterval` | The interval (ms) between queries to the API when waiting for report processing.  Total wait time is `sonar.buildbreaker.queryMaxAttempts * sonar.buildbreaker.queryInterval`. | `10000` | |
| `sonar.buildbreaker.forbiddenConf` | Comma-separated list of `key=value` pairs that should break the build. | | `sonar.gallio.mode=skip` |
| `sonar.buildbreaker.alternativeServerUrl` | URL to use for web service requests. If unset, uses the `serverUrl` property from `${sonar.working.directory}/report-task.txt`. | | |
| `sonar.buildbreaker.preview.issuesSeverity` | Fails the build in preview analysis mode if the severity of issues is equal to or more severe than the selection. | `Disabled` | Available selections are (case insensitive): `Disabled`, `INFO`, `MINOR`, `MAJOR`, `CRITICAL`, `BLOCKER` |
